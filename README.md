# To-Do List App

A simple and convenient task management app developed in JavaScript using Local Storage. This application allows users to easily create, edit, reorder, pin, and delete tasks, as well as mark tasks as completed. Data is stored in local storage, so the task list remains accessible even after closing the browser.

## Features

- **Add Task** — create new tasks with descriptions.
- **Delete Task** — remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Edit Task** — update existing tasks as needed.
- **Move Task** — rearrange tasks to better manage priorities.
- **Pin Task** — pin important tasks to the top of the list.
- **Complete Task** — mark tasks as completed to track progress.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript** — main programming language for application functionality.
- **HTML/CSS** — basic structure and styling to enhance the app’s visual appeal.
- **Local Storage** — client-side data storage to maintain tasks between sessions.
